  You're gonna want to display stuff...
  The stuff is in an array...

  Work your magic here...

  public class Stuff {

    public static void main(String args[]) {
      String[] stuff = {"Foo", "Bar", "Baz", "Quz"};
      *:choice:* {
        System.out.println(s);
      }
    }
  }
   
choices:
  choice:
    dropdown: ["for(String s : stuff)",
               "for each s in stuff",
               "do",
               "while s < stuff.length"]

answers:
  choice: "for(String s : stuff)"

explanation: |
  Your magic has failed you i see...
  Remember how you can iterate through an array...

  there's the `for(int i = 0; i < stuff.length; i++){}`

  but that's not there...
  and then there's the 'foreach'

  for(String s : stuff) {
    ...
  }
