  You're gonna need to type to the following variables.
  Look at the code and determine what type the variables should be.
  Be as specfic as you can.


  Scanner s = new Scanner("1 Hello 2 World 3 And 4 The 5 Rest"); 
  *:typeA:* a = s.next();
  *:typeB:* b = s.next();
  *:typeC:* c = s.nextInt();
  *:typeD:* d = s.nextLine();


choices:
  typeA: 
    dropdown: ["int", "float", "String", "Object", "double", "char[]"]
  typeB: 
    dropdown: ["int", "float", "String", "Object", "double", "char[]"]
  typeC: 
    dropdown: ["int", "float", "String", "Object", "double", "char[]"]
  typeD: 
    dropdown: ["int", "float", "String", "Object", "double", "char[]"]

answers:
  typeA: "String"
  typeB: "String"
  typeC: "int"
  typeD: "String"


explanation: |
  While the Object type can be used for anything in java, it is
  generally, not usefull to do so.

  So for the given example we need to know what the scanner methods
  return.

  we can assume that 'nextInt' returns an int and 'nextLine' returns a String.
  
  we can also intiuite that since the scanner primarily deals with Strings that 
  the 'next' method also returns a String.
