  Time to get hot...

  Let's find out how hot something is in fahrenheit.
  Add the missing lines to this program so that it reads a double representing the temerature
  in celsius and outputs the temerature in fahrenheit.

  import java.util.Scanner;

  public class TemperatureCalculations {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          *:scannerLine:*;

          System.out.println("Enter something hot (in celsius):");
          double celsius = *:readDouble:*;
          
          double fahrenheit = 1.8 * celsius + 32;

          System.out.println(celsius + " in Celsius is " + *:result:* + " in Fahrenheit");
          
      }
  }
   
choices:
  scannerLine:
    dropdown: ["Scanner s = Scanner.create(System.in)", "Scanner s = new.Scanner(System.in)","Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in)", "Scanner s = Scanner.new(System.in)"]
  readDouble:
    dropdown: ["s.next()", "s.nextLine()", "s.hasNextDouble()", "s.nextDouble()"]
  result:
    dropdown: ["celsius", "fahrenheit", "s.nextDouble()", "s"]


answers:
  scannerLine: "Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in)"
  readDouble: "s.nextDouble()"
  result: "fahrenheit"

explanation: |
  The scanner class, accepts a input stream as a parameter and
  uses this input stream to get inputs out of it.

  in this case we want to read from standard in.

  so the first line becomes.

    Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
  
  we notice that the celsius variable is of type double.

  so we need to use the "nextDouble" method of the scanner
  to get next thing that the user typed in, in the form of a double.

  so the second line becomes:
    double celsius = s.nextDouble();

  Right at the end, it's a question of paying attention to the intent
  of the program.

  The program is ment to take a double representing a temperature in celsius,
  and output what that temp is in fahrenheit.

  so the last line becomes:
    System.out.println(celsius + " in Celsius is " + fahrenheit + " in Fahrenheit");
