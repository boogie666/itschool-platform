  You wring the following code because Boogie said so...

  public class Foo{
    public String bar = "baz";

    public String toString(){
      return bar;
    }
  }

  This class needs a custom toString method, because otherwise it's 
  just not pritty when printing out the console.

  What needs to be added to the method such that if its signiture is wrong the compiler 
  will let us know.

choices:
  chooseTheAnswer:
    radio: ["@SuppressWarnings", "@Nullable", "@Override", "@CompilerWarning"] 

answers:
  chooseTheAnswer: "@Override"

explanation: |
  The @Override annotation is used to mark the method as being inherited.

  If we get the signiture or return type wrong the java compiler will complain
  that the annotation is used, but the method is not present in the super class.
