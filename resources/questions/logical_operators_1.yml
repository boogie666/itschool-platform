  You are working on a code block to assign customers to offices based on location. 
  Customers are assigned to offices as follows:

  Customers in the South region and in Texas are assigned to the Dallas office

  Customers in North and West regions are assigned to the Salt Lake City (SLC) office

  All other customers are assigned to the Atlanta office

  Fill in the missing pieces of code to complete the method.


  public static void main(String args[]) {

    if(region == "South" *:choice1:* state == "Texas") {
      office = "Dallas";
    }
    else if (region == "North" *:choice2:* region == "West") {
      office = "SLC";
    }
    else {
      office = "Atlanta";
    }

    System.out.println(office);
  }

  
choices:
  choice1:
    dropdown: ["&&", "&", "||", "AND", "OR"]
  choice2:
    dropdown: ["&&", "&", "||", "AND", "OR"]

answers:
  choice1: "&&"
  choice2: "||"
 
explanation: |
  This code uses compound operators. 
  To start, the && operator is used to indicate an AND as the customer has to be in the South region
  and in Texas to be assigned to the Dallas office.
  For the second operator, the customer can be either in the North region OR in the West region. 
  The || operator fills the OR condition. Thirdly,

  public static void main(String args[]) {

    if(region == "South" && state == "Texas") {
      office = "Dallas";
    }
    else if (region == "North" || region == "West") {
      office = "SLC";
    }
    else {
      office = "Atlanta";
    }

    System.out.println(office);
  }
