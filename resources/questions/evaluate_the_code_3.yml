  Evaluate the code below and select the correct anwers from dropdowns.

    01  String value1 = "127";
    02  value1 += 1;
    03  System.out.println(value1);
    04  System.out.println((double) value1);
    05  System.out.println(value1 + value1);

  What is the output of line 03? *:string:*
  What is the output of line 04? *:castToDouble:*
  What is the output of line 05? *:stringConcat:*


choices:
  string:
    dropdown: ["1271","128", "Compile Error"]
  castToDouble:
    dropdown: ["Compile Error", "1271.0", "128.0"]
  stringConcat:
    dropdown: ["12711271", "258", "Compile Error"]

answers:
  string: "1271"
  castToDouble: "Compile Error"
  stringConcat: "12711271"

explanation: |
  Addition in strings is concatenation. 
  if any value is 'added' to a string, that value becomes a string 
  and the two string are concatenated togheter.

  A string can't be cast to a double. This will result in a compile time error.
