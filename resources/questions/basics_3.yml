  You want the this fancy program to output the value of some fancy math...

  "The result of the fancy math is 31800."

  public class Foo {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
      int a = 29000;
      double b = .06;
      int c = 1000;
      int d = a + c;
      double total = d * b + d;
      *:choice:*
    }

  }

choices:
  choice:
    dropdown: ["System.out.println(\"The result of the fancy math is \" & total);",
               "System.out.println(\"The result of the fancy math is \" + total);",
               "System.in.println(\"The result of the fancy math is \" + total);",
               "System.in.println(\"The result of the fancy math is \" & total);"]

answers:
  choice: "System.out.println(\"The result of the fancy math is \" + total);"
