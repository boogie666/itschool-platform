  You have the following value
  
    String x = "true";

  Which of the following lines convers the string into a boolean value
  *:codeLine:*


choices:
  codeLine: 
    radio: ["boolean b = (boolean) x;", "Boolean b = Boolean.parseBoolean(x);", "Boolean b = String.toBoolean(x)", "Boolean b = x.asBoolean();"]

answers:
  codeLine: "Boolean b = Boolean.parseBoolean(x);"

explanation: |
  All primary datatypes have a 'wrapper' class.
  (Generally it's called like the primitive, but starting with uppercase)

  These wrapper classes offer various ways to transform the values (among other features)

  One transform is 'parsing'. 

  Parsing will atempt to transform the string representation of a given type to the actuall representation.

  In this case
  
  Boolean.parseBoolean(x) is the correct answer as the parseBoolean static method of the Boolean class
  does exactly this.

  for the given case we know that the code will work, since the value of x is the string representation of true.
  (it world also work for false)

  but any other value for x would throw an exception at runtime.
