  Some bean counter in your office did the math wrong
  for you monthly salary.

  Here's the math he used

  int amount = 60000;
  double tax = .10;
  int bonus = 1000;
  double total = amount + bonus * tax;

  System.out.println(total);

  The output is 60100. It should be 66100.

  What does the variable declaration for the total need to be to fix this?
  
  *:choice:*
 
choices:
  choice:
    radio: ["double total = (amount + bonus) * tax + amount", 
            "double total = amount + bonus * tax + amount", 
            "double total = amount + bonus * (tax + amount)", 
            "double total = (amount + bonus) * tax"]


   
answers:
  choice: "double total = (amount + bonus) * tax + amount"

  This is a classic example of an order of operations error. 
  Remember the order

      Parentheses
      Exponents
      Multiplication
      Division
      Addition
      Subtraction

  The bonus * tax is happening first. 1000 * .10 = 100. 
  Add that to the amount (60000) and you have 60100.
  The amount + bonus needs to happen first.
  That portion needs parentheses. 
  The result then would be (60000 + 1000) * .10 = 61000 * .10 = 6100. 
  That amount needs to be added to the original in order to complete the total. 
  The complete code, then, looks like this

  int amount = 60000;
  double tax = .10;
  int bonus = 1000;
  double total = (amount + bonus) * tax + amount;

  System.out.println(total);
