  Evaluate the following code example, and, using the drop-down lists, fill in the missing pieces of code to accomplish the following:

    The scanner should attempt to read the data and display content from it.
    If there is an error, the error message should be displayed.
    The last line of output should read "Thank you for using the scanner."


  public static void main(String[] args) {
    *:choice1:*{
      Scanner scanner = new Scanner("1 Red 2 Blue 3 Green 4 Yellow 5 Silver");
      Object res1 = scanner.next();
      Object res2 = scanner.nextInt();
      Object res3 = scanner.next();
    }*:choice2:*(Exception ex) {
      System.out.println(ex.*:choice3:* ());
    } *:choice4:* {
      System.out.println("Thank you for using the scanner.");
    }
  }

  
choices:
  choice1:
    dropdown: ["try", "catch","finally"]
  choice2:
    dropdown: ["try", "catch","finally", "error"]
  choice3:
    dropdown: ["getMessage", "printMessage", "displayMessage"]
  choice4:
    dropdown: ["try", "catch", "finally", "done"]


answers:
  choice1: "try"
  choice2: "catch"
  choice3: "getMessage"
  choice4: "finally"
  

explanation: |
  This is an example of a try-catch-finally block becoming necessary. 
  The try block should be around the code being attempted, which is the code using the Scanner utility. 
  The catch block catches exceptions and displays their information. 
  In this instance, the getMessage method will display the error message, if there is one. 
  The finally block runs whether the try or catch block run prior to the code in the finally block. 
  The completed code looks like this:

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    try {
      Scanner scanner = new Scanner("1 Red 2 Blue 3 Green 4 Yellow 5 Silver");
      Object res1 = scanner.next();
      Object res2 = scanner.nextInt();
      Object res3 = scanner.next();
    } catch(Exception ex) {
      System.out.println(ex.getMessage());
    } finally {
      System.out.println("Thank you for using the scanner.");
    }
  }
