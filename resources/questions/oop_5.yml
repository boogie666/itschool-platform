answers:
  chooseTheAnswer: "only accesible by the Person class or any class in the same package"

explanation: |
  When no visiblity keyword is used for a field, it marked as 'package private'
  also known as 'default visiblity'. 
  This allows the field to be accesed by the current class or anything else within the same package.

  'private' means only this class.
  'protected' means accesible by current class or any subclasses, or anything in the same package.
  'public' meens anybody.
