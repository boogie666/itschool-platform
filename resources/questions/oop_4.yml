answers:
  chooseTheAnswer: "only accesible by the Shape class, any subclass, or any class in the same package"

explanation: |
  the 'protected' marks a field as being accesible by the current class, 
  any sub class or any class within the same package.

  'private' means only this class.
  'public' meens anybody.
  '<nothing>' means accesible by this class, and any classes in the same package.
